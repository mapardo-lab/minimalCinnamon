# The minimal model

Machine Learning analysis for the dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madaraweerasingha/cinnamon-quality-classification

Multiple metrics are available for classifying cinnamon samples into three quality groups. Through a simple yet rigorous analysis, we designed a robust model that achieves error-free classification. In real-world applications, this model would reduce classification costs by requiring only half of the available data inputs.
